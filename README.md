# bitcoin-p2sh-2of3

### **Data & Web Science MSc Program**
### *Decentralized Technologies Course - Assignment 1, 2022, Bitcoin*

For this assignment you will need to implement two scripts using Python 3 and any
additional library of your choice (bitcoin-utils is highly recommended though).
The first one will create a P2SH Bitcoin address that implements a MULTISIG scheme,
where all funds sent to it should be locked until 2 out of 3 potential signers sign a
transaction to move the funds elsewhere.
The second program will allow spending all funds from this P2SH address.
Both programs should:
* use regtest/testnet
* assume a local Bitcoin regtest/testnet node is running
The first program should:
* accept 3 public keys for the purpose of creating the P2SH address that will
implement a 2-of-3 MULTISIG scheme
* display the P2SH address
The second program should:
* accept 2 private keys (used to sign transactions) and 1 public key (to recreate the
redeem script as above â€“ the other two public keys may be derived from the
provided private keys)
* accept a P2SH address to get the funds from (the one created by the first script)
* accept a P2PKH address to send the funds to
* check if the P2SH address has any UTXOs to get funds from
* calculate the appropriate fees with respect to the size of the transaction
* send all funds that the P2SH address received to the P2PKH address provided
* display the raw unsigned transaction
* sign the transaction
* display the raw signed transaction
* display the transaction id
* verify that the transaction is valid and will be accepted by the Bitcoin nodes
* if the transaction is valid, send it to the blockchain

there is some repetition between the 2 programs; this is fine[^1].
[^2]:you may test your scripts by sending some funds to the P2SH address you created
[^3]:you may query the local Bitcoin testnet/regtest node using the JSON-RPC interface
